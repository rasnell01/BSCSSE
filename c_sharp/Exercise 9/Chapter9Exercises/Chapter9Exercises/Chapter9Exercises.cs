        objects and demonstrates the Room methods. The Room constructor requires
        parameters for length, width, and height fields; use a variety of values when
        constructing the objects. The Room class also contains a field for wall area of the
        Room and number of gallons of paint needed to paint the room. Both of these values
        are computed by calling private methods. Include read-only properties to get a
        Room’s values. A room is assumed to have four walls, and you do not need to allow for
        windows and doors, and you do not need to allow for painting the ceiling. A room
        requires one gallon of paint for every 350 square feet (plus an extra gallon for any
        square feet greater than 350). In other words, a 12 3 10 room with 9-foot ceilings has
        396 square feet of wall space, and so requires two gallons of paint. */
