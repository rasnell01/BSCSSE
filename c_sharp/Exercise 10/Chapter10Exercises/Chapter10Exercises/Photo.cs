/* Photo that includes fields for width and height in inches and properties for each field.
Include a protected price field, and set it to $3.99 for an 8-inch by 10-inch photo,
$5.99 for a 10-inch by 12-inch photo, and $9.99 for any other size (because custom
cutting is required). The price field requires a get accessor but no set accessor. Also
include a ToString() method that returns a string constructed from the return value
of the objectâ€™s GetType() method and the values of the fields. */
