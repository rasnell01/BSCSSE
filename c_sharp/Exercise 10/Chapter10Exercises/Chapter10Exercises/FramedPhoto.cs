/*Derive two subclasses—
MattedPhoto and FramedPhoto. The MattedPhoto class includes a string field to
hold a color, and the FramedPhoto class includes two string fields that hold the frame’s
material (such as silver) and style (such as modern). The price for a MattedPhoto
increases by $10 over its base cost, and the price for a FramedPhoto increases by $25
over its base cost. Each subclass should include a ToString() method that overrides
the parent class version. */
