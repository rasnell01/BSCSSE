 System.out.println();
 
 Scanner - contains methods that break input into units called tokens.
 A token is a set of characters that is separated from the next set by whitespace.
 
 
 System.out.prinln("This is" + " a test" + 38*4+3-52); is one parameter being passed. Commas 
 seperate the parameters that are being passed. 
 
 optional access specifiers: public or private (protected) package(default)
 optional static modifier
 Praenthesis are required for a method.
 	ie: System.out.println();
		stuff = numberPhrase.first();
		stuff = numberPhrase.nextln();

Implementation hiding
encapsulation of method details within a class.

interface
the only part of a method that the client sees or with which interacts.

Dead code: will never reach due to sequental nature.


overloading methods: 


runtime of process!!!

fundementals are the key.

The things that apply to functions:
	1. cohesion -> top metric -> Does one thing and one thing only! -> High
	2. coupling -> top metric -> How connected they are! -> low
	3. referential transparency ->
