	try to make it as thurough as possible.
	
for testing do it for all possible paths: the number of decisions + 1.

Why should you choose a for loop? 
	when you know exactly how many time you are going to go through.
	
while and if:
	while runs until it's terminated. 
	if runs once. 
	if else make sure it's necisarry 

	
	if ( conditional expression that evaluates to true or false ) 
		statement;

		statement;
		
	curley braces for multiple statement if/while loops.

Class: at its lowest level is a record. tuple (x,y) <- an ordered pair.

class orderedPair{
int x;
int y;
}

class CubeTupple{
int x;
int y;
int z;
}

class Item{
int size;
}
Item myItem = new Item(); <-an object 

A program consists of Data + Algorithms!
